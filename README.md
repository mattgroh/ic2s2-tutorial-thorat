# Custom High-Throughput Virtual Experiments with Thorat Tutorial

Custom High-Throughput Virtual Experiments with Thorat is a tutorial and starter pack for building custom dynamic websites for computational social science experiments.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Github repo

Clone or download the Github repo

```
git clone git@github.com:mattgroh/ic2s2-tutorial-thorat.git
cd ic2s2-tutorial-thorat
```

### Set up your virtual environment

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch the server

```
python run.py
```

Now, go to localhost:5005 on your browser 

### 1. We'll need to uncomment Step 1 to get to "hello world"

### 2. Now, let's start building this website. Uncomment Step 2 and start exploring.

### 3. Can you build your own About page?

### 4. Let's build in a survey and a backend to collect the data. We need to uncomment code again. 

### 5. Let's see what that data looks like by pulling up a Jupyter notebook

### 6. Now, let's see what a full working app might look like

### 7. Congratulations! You built an interactive experiment!
